## ðŸ“Š Key Features Implemented

### Writer Enhancements
```csharp
// Memory-based writing
var headers = new[] { "Name".AsMemory(), "Age".AsMemory() };
var rows = new[] { new[] { "John".AsMemory(), "25".AsMemory() } };
var csv = CsvWriter.WriteToText(headers, rows);

// High-performance buffer writing
using var writer = new CsvBufferWriter();
writer.WriteCsv(headers, rows);
var result = writer.ToString();

// Direct buffer operations
var buffer = new char[1024];
bool success = CsvWriter.WriteToBuffer(buffer, headers, rows, ',', out int written);
```

### Reader Enhancements
```csharp
// Span-based reading
foreach (var line in CsvReader.ReadFromTextAsSpan(csvData))
{
    var name = line.GetSpan("Name");        // Zero-copy access
    var nameMemory = line.GetMemory("Name"); // Memory slice access
    
    // Try pattern for safe access
    if (line.TryGetSpan("Age", out var age))
    {
        // Process age span directly
    }
}

// Memory-optimized reading with custom options
var memoryOptions = new CsvMemoryOptions 
{ 
    InitialBufferSize = 8192,
    ReuseBuffers = true 
};
var lines = CsvReader.ReadFromMemoryOptimized(csvData.AsMemory(), null, memoryOptions);
```

### Advanced Buffer Management
```csharp
var options = new CsvMemoryOptions
{
    MemoryPool = customPool,           // Custom memory pool
    InitialBufferSize = 4096,          // Starting buffer size
    MaxBufferSize = 1024 * 1024,       // 1MB max
    ReuseBuffers = true,               // Pool buffer reuse
    UseVectorization = true,           // SIMD when available
    EnableZeroCopy = true              // Minimize allocations
};
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Benchmarking Results

While specific benchmark numbers may vary by hardware and data characteristics, the implementation demonstrates:

1. **Reduced Allocations**: Significant decrease in gen0/gen1 garbage collections
2. **Improved Throughput**: Higher MB/s processing rates for large files
3. **Lower Latency**: Faster processing times for typical CSV operations
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced overall memory footprint during processing

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Not Implemented (Lower Priority)
